Hi! this is a code that I have created for calculating tilt angles of solar active regions

Data source: SDO/HMI magnetograms have been used primarily which are accessible at http://jsoc.stanford.edu

Principle: While buoyantly rising through the solar convection zone, magnetic flux tubes experience coriolis force and deviate from the east-west direction. This deviation can be observed as tilt in the axis of emerged bipolar magnetic regions on the surface of the Sun instead of being parallel to the solar equator.

Purpose: Using the flux weighted barycenter of positive and negative polarities I calculate the axis of the active region and compute its tilt. I further measure their HALEness and JOYness -- parameters that depict the large scale physical orientation of the active region in a solar hemisphere at a certain instant of time for a given solar cycle.

Note:
x is distance from the left of the image.
y is distance from the top of the image.
